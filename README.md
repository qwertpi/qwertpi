### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a 17-year-old interested in almost every part of computer science but the bits that are most reflected in my GitHub are functional programming, and artificial neural nets.
### [I have a blog](https://qwertpi.medium.com/index-7374f83d1011) that I post to very sporadically

#### I'm currently most proud of (loosely in descending order):
1. [My use of case classes in my solution to day 12 part 1 of the 2020 Advent of Code](https://github.com/qwertpi/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/12/a.scala)
2. [The testing in my datastructs and alogs repo](https://github.com/qwertpi/datastructs-and-algorithms)
3. [The interpolation gifs generated by my MNIST-INFOGAN](https://github.com/qwertpi/mnist-infogan/blob/master/interpolated.gif)


#### Languages I can code in fairly comfortably: Python, Scala
#### I'm currently learning: Scala, functional programming, test driven development
