### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a 16-year-old interested in almost every part of computer science but the bits that are most reflected in my GitHub are functional programming, and artificial neural nets.
### [I have a blog](https://qwertpi.medium.com/index-7374f83d1011) that I post to very sporadically

#### Languages I can code in fairly comfortably: Python, Scala
#### I'm currently learning: Scala, functional programming, test driven development
